# Webpack Starter - Output Management

## Steps

1. In root folder run `npm init -y`.
2. Run `npm i lodash`.
3. Run `npm i -D webpack webpack-cli html-webpack-plugin webpack-dev-server`.

### Notes

1. `devServer.static` simply tells webpack dev server where to find static files.
2. All you need to enable webpack dev server is to install it and add `"start": "webpack serve --open"`
   to scripts in package.json.
